<h1>About AC-Base</h1>

AC-Base is a PHP Stand Alone Framework, this means that it doesn’t use any other PHP libraries to build its core functionalities. It was built in the year 2013 as a private framework as its purpose is to be used only in some private system/software developed by Awonsa company. But after more than a decade we decided to publish it as we thought its maturity can help developers or some companies to have a flexible, lighter and easy-to-use option as their main framework to develop a system or website.

Why AC-Base? Well, ‘AC’ stands for Absolute Codes, it means “Flexible”, as a developer you have lots of options where to write your codes. This is mainly for a reason to allow each user of this framework to conceptualize their own folderring structure and file naming as well as additional security. Though, by default it is using a MC (Model->Controller) approach. This is a shortened process compared to MVC (Model->View->Controller).

What are the uniquenesses of this framework?
<ul>
<li>It only loads PHP files you need to load for a route/page or only those files you require under the controller file.</li>
<li>You can create sub controllers and reuse parent controller methods.</li>
<li>You can re-use other controllers methods.</li>
<li>You can fake routes. It will help improve your app security.</li>
<li>It allows you to fully control everything and implement your own functionality.</li>
<li>It doesn't use ORM by default, but you are free to extend any libraries</li>
<li>It has ready form builder that is using Bootstrap CSS Framework</li>
<li>It has ready table view builder that is connected to the model</li>
</ul>
